##Paths to destination folders and codes/commands to the linux server

##To find the SSH PORT number of a linux server;

    >>    /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d

##Server configuration path;
    >>    /etc/nginx/sites-available/
    >>    cat default

##Service Configuration path;
    >>   /etc/systemd/system
    >> cat any service to see the file inside it.

##SSL Certificate
    >>  /etc/letsencrypt/live/lbacc.himshang.com.np/fullchain.pem;
    >>  /etc/letsencrypt/live/lbacc.himshang.com.np/privkey.pem;
(Need to add the .pem file for the same including the private .pem file in the configuration file to ensure ssl certificate is in use and ready.)
